Trees
            
            A <- Root
          /   \
        B       C
      /    \      \
    D       E       F

We're going to focus on binary trees.
    -Where every node is connected to up to 2 other nodes
    -Left and right children
    -Root: Top node in the tree
    -Parent node: "A is the parent of B and C"
    -Leaf: a node with 0 children
    -Children do not point back to their parents in the tree
    -Good news! Trees are ascyclic, meaning no cycles!
    -Recursivley traverse the data structure.
