Next Topic for 2 weeks: 
Linked Structures

    -Recall traits of arrays
        -When you create an array, you must pick thd size and the type
        -With limitation we'll address with linked structures is the fixed size part
        -
    -Goal: Allocate space as needed; not using fixed size. Same for deallocation, just take away the one element

The building block for the linked structures is going to be...
    -*Nodes*
     -can hold a value
     -Has the ability to point to another node 
     -Not pointing to a node at the end is null
