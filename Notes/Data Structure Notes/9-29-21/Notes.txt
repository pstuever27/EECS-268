Lists
    -You are allowed to insert, remove, look at values anywhere in the Lists
    -No notion of FIFO or LIFO
    -All adds to a list come in the form of an insert at an index
        -Yes, you can insert on an empty list
        -The index you choose is the index the new value will sit at
    -When we remove, we pick an index to remove
    -When we get an entry we also get it from a particular index
    -Lists do track their own length

How we build it
    -Node-based implementation (called a LinkedList)
        -Will have a bunch of nodes pointing down the list until it reaches nullptr
        -m_front will be the front of the list.
