Uses of heaps
-Add all the following values to a min heap: 20, 15, 10, 5, 85, 3, 1, 2
-What would be the first value to be removed? It would be 1 because it is the minimum 
-What order would I get the values out? 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 85
-Notice that our heap self organizes values and produces them in a sorted order

Heaps could be used to implement a Priority Queue
-Normal Queue - FIFO 
-Priority Queue - Based on priority 
   -As long as the class being stored in the heap can define priority order, then the heap will organize the items appropriately

Boardwork: Write the upheap method using parent formula (i-1)/2

//upHeap
template <typename T>
void MinHeap<T>::upHeap(int index)
{
	if(index != 0)
	{

	if(m_arr[index] <= m_arr[(index-1)/2])
	{
		T temp = m_arr[(index-1)/2];
		m_arr[(index-1)/2] = m_arr[index];
		m_arr[index] = temp;
		
		upHeap((index-1)/2);
	}
}
}
