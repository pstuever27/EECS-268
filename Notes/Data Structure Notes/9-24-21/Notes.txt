Queue

Imagine a coffee shop:
    People need to get in line to get served, people don't cut and the person at the front gets served. Then the line moves up

This is a Queue
    - There are two access points in the queue.
        -front and back
    -While stacks had one access point at the top, queues have two.

Queue Methods:
    Vocab
    enqueue - Add to the back of a queue
    dequeue - remove from the front of a queue
    peek_front - look at frontmost value
    isEmpty - is the queue is empty

Boardwork: Defind the constructor and enqueue for our node-based implementation of our QueueInterface.
