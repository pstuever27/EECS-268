Notes

//assume we are in main
//assume we have this linked list created

myList.insert(2, 'Z')

If we want to insert a new node into the list, we have to do some magic
    -we need m_front to point to the front 
    -we need a pointer to the target index we want
    -we need a newNode that will be inserted to the list just before the target
    -and we need a pointer to the node just before the target

To do this, we write
    -newNode->setNext(target); 
    -increase the length by 1

Where can we put stuff?
    -Insert at the front of the list
        -We insert at index 0
        -Set m_front to the newNode
    -Inserting at the end is what we outlined above
    -Inserting at the end   
        -index is the length
    -Range of indices goes from 0 to length (inclusive)

Boardwork------------------------------
Define void insert(int index, T entry); for our linked list.
