Notes:
Removing from linked lists
    -We have m_front, jumper, and oneBefore
    -Now we need oneAfter
    -We need to have the oneBefore pointer use setNext(oneAfter)
    -Now the length is reduced by one

    -If we get rid of the front pointer 
        -We have m_front get set to the second node, then have jumper delete the node.

    -When we insert, we insert from 0 up to and including the length
    -When we remove, we can only remove from 0 to length-1.

Boardwork -----
    -Write List<T>::remove(int index)

Food for thought:

template <typename T>
void eraseAfter(ListInterface<T>& list, int index)
{
    //Goal: Delete everything in a list after a given index.
}
