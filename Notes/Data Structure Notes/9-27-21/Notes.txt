Queue Boardwork 1-----------

Write dequeue method definition for Queue.h

Queue Boardwork 2-----------

Define the following function...
    Assume we are in main.cpp (not tethered to a class)
    Assume:
    - 3 total tokens
    - isNum(char)

    bool isPreFix(Stack<char> tokens);

                We typically write our math expressions in in-fix notation:
                    5+3 (num, operator, number)

                Prefix notation, the operator is first:
                    +5 3 (this is dumb)

Basically, find out if a stack of characters such as:
+
5
3
is in prefix notation.
